PHASE 1: WEEK ONE CHALLENGE
Description
This is the first independent code challenge undertaken while at Moringa School.
Required to create a folder in your local enviroment and a corresponding README.md file to store the code written in this challenge.
Once this is done create a repository on your GitHub account and initialize the same repository in your local environment.
Create index.js, index.html, index.css files.
Use your index.js file to write down the solution to each challenge.
Thereafter, push the solution to the repository you created and submit the repository link for grading.
 
Project Setup
The project is set up as follows: -
a. Writing code in index.js file;
b. Inputing the code in index.js into index.html file; and
c. Running tests in index.html browser page

a. Writing code in index.js file
The codes for the challenges have been entered in index.js file as from the first to the third as follows: -

Challenge 1
Used if, else if and else in the function getStudentgrade to input student marks to return the correct grades as follows:- 
A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.
I used if in my validation to ensure the grades output  did not return a wrong grade for grades not between 0 and  100

Challenge 2
Use if, else if and else in the function detectOverspeeding to input the speed of a car which returned "Ok" for a speed of less than 70 and gave a demerit point for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70)
In the event that the driver gets more than 12 points(exceeds a speed of 130), the function should print: “License suspended”.

Challenge 3
Use if, else if and else in the functions to calculate payee, NHIFDeductions and NSSFDeductions.
Calculate net salary by calling the fuctions used to calculate payee, NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions and gross salary.to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary. 
NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.

This creates a useful tool to calculate net salaries for employees.

b. Inputing the code in index.js into index.html file
Create sections for each challenge. Within each section, create a div element to hold the <input> for the individual challenge which creates a textBox.
For each section use the button element with the onClick attribute to create a submit button.
The textBox and submit button in each section allow a user to get the desired output(as coded in the index.js file) on the index.html browser page up0n typing the any value.
In order to ensure the that the output is in line with the code in the index.js file, write functions in index.html file to ensure the output is visible on the index.html file.

c. Running tests in index.html browser page
Go to the index.html browser page and type values in the textBoxes and press the submit buttons to verify that inputs return a certain output as specified in the code in index.js.
